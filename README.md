# Bored Games project for TUAS Sovellusohjelmointi course

This repository contains a website for renting board games. Users are able to add, edit & delete their own board games and rent games that other users have added. The website is made with django web framework and python. Website has certain limitations that for example users can only rent 3 board games at the time and they have to return at least one of them before renting next.
